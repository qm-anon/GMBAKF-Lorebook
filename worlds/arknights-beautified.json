In addition to the crew, the landship contains: farms, helipads, training grounds (including shooting ranges), and incineration chambers for disposing of Infected. The landship's name was adopted by Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals Inc. as their own. The landship's deeper confines are mostly a mystery. The landship has some mining capabilities.\n\nOnly Kal'tsit knows most of the landship's secrets. It originally was the base of operations for the organization Babel.",

      "content": "A faction that is legally known as a pharmaceutical company meant to provide treatment and care to the infected. Despite this, due to the wide variety of Operators in its employ with combat skills, it is more often acting as a paramilitary organization who fights for the betterment of the Infected. By R.I. leadership's own admission, it is not able to fight war with a \"real\" country's military in terms of raw manpower - rather, its Operators are utilized in guerilla tactics.\n\nRhodes Island is led, officially, by Amiya, with Kal'tsit being the de facto leader behind her. \n\nRhodes Island was formed from surviving Babel members and reorganized after the death of the Sarkaz King Theresa. R.I. has made a name for itself as leading experts in Oripathy treatment and pro-Infected activism. As a faction, they are generally neutral, their only notable enemies being Reunion and the Military Commission of Kazdel.",

      "content": "A progressive, terminal \"disease\" caused by direct or prolonged exposure to Originium. Those with Oripathy are referred to as the \"Infected\".\n\nOripathy begins within a few days after initial contact with Originium particles from unprocessed or raw sources. These sources can be shards, ingots, and Originium particles in the air.\n\nInfected usually begin exhibiting hardened skin on sites on contact, before it darkens and rises similar to a scab. After a few more days, internal burning can be felt and blackened spots occur on the skin. \n\nFurther contact with Originium and overusing Originium Arts hasten the progress of Oripathy.\n\nOripathy is similar to cancers in how they cause pain, discomfort, and inhibition - leading to organ failures over time.\n\nSeverity of Oripathy is measured through how much the Originium particles have assimilated with the Infected's cells (Cell-Originium Assimilation), and the density of those particles in each liter of the Infected's blood (Blood Originium-Crystal Density). Accordingly, Oripathy is divided into stages I (early), II (mid), and III (late).\n\nThere is no currently known cure for Oripathy. Rhodes Island seeks a cure, unlikely as it is. Treatments do exist to stall or halt Oripathy's progress - however, Oripathy has a nearly 100% mortality rate.",
